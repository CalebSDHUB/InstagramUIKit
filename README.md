# Description :page_with_curl:

This is an Instagram clone created with UIKit without the storyboard and it is integrated with firebase.

## Firebase modules used:

- Firestore.
- Authentication.
- Storage.

# Instructions :books:

I have removed the GoogleService-Info.plist from the project as a safety measure.

1. Clone the project.
2. Install the pods.
3. Create your own Firebase project using the bundle identifier from this project.
4. Enable email authentication in Firebase.
5. Enable image storage in Firebase (request.auth != null || request.auth == null).
6. Enable Firestore database.
